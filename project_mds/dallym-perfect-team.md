## Title
Dally M - Perfect team


## Description
  ### Problem / brief
  Create a custom layout/interactive to showcase the best players for each position making the perfect team. Each player will have multiple nominees each with key stats a short write off. Will need a fast turn around with content coming in live.

  ### Solution
  A simple grid for each of the winners that can be clicked on to reveal more information including the runners-up. Pulling content from a Google spreadsheet enabled multiple designers and journalists share the work load of data entry and proofing, that could then be simply exported into the custom web-app.
