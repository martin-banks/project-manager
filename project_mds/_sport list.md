-- Generic player ratings --


## Description
  ### Problem / brief
  New custom layout to display player stats for a team/group of players.

  ### Solution
  With large groups of players presented at once it can be diffucult to understand the significance of individual stats in the larger group. To help with this, each player is represented as a tile on a grid with a single statistic and the tiles are sorted by it's value.

  The user can toggle through different stats and see how each player faired in different categories (points scored, games played etc). For larger sets that feature (for example top 50 players across all teams in a season), additional filters can be used to only show a sub-set; like their favourite team to help them find the information they are most interested in.

  ### Evolution
  Adding additional controls to create a custom head-to-head list. 

  Highlights over filters to make it easier to spot select information but still maintain the context of the larger set.
