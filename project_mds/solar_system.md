## Title
Solar system

## Description
### What
Recreate an interactive, 3d model of our solar system with an information overlay for each planet and moon. Each body should have the correct orbit, rotation speed and size (proportional to each other)


### Why
I want to learn more about using WebGL (3D in the browser), specifically the THREE.js library

### How


### Evolution
- Include proportiloanlly accurate distances
- Free camera mode to explore more freely
- VR version!
- Add information overlays - facts about each.
- Offset orbit axis correctly
- Is there information on current stage of rotation so each is in an accurate orbit pattern
