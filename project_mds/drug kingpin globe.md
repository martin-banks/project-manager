## Title
Australia's untouchable drug lord

## Description
  ### Problem / brief
  An exclusive story by Charles Miranda on one of the biggest drug suppliers to Australia watched by authorities around the world; how can we visualise this?

  ### Solution
  The information about his global interest is woven throughout the main story. To prevent duplicating information and to maintain interest in the article, let's incoorperate the visualisation with the article. 

  Using D3.js, a full screen globe is rendered in teh background; as the readers progresses through the story talking about his impact on different countries, the globe spins to bring that location into focus.

  ### Evolution
  [x] Make this more easily reusable
  [ ] A better solution for use in-app (this type of interaction is not possible with the current app article template)
