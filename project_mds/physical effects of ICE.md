## Title
Physical effects of ICE

## Description
  ### Problem / brief
  ICE has a multitude of negative effects on the whole body, display this list mapped to parts of the human body.

  ### Solution
  The list of effects is too long to display in a concise graphic for mobile screens and secondary to the main focus of the article. Instead, create a hotspot based interactive for readers to explore. I used Adobe Illustrator to create the main layout as an svg, this can then be directly manipulated in JavaScript and CSS to add the interactivity.

  ### Evolution
  Understand, document and template this process of creating simple interactives for other designers to use.

  ### Learn
  Using Illustrator to generate an SVG as code that can be targetted in for DOM events
