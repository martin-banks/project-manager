## Title
Earthquake map

## Description
  ### Problem / brief
  A spate of serious earthquakes through Indonesia got me wondering; how many earthquakes and how serious they are happen around the world? Let's build something to find out

  ### Solution
  Using data from the USGS earthquake database to plot every earthquake around the world over the previous 7-days on an interactive map, the size and colour indicating the severity. Each marker can interacted with to display a short profile of the that event including location, magnitude and if there is a tsunami risk

  ### Evolution
  Display more of the information about each quake. 

  ### Learn
  Creating custom, interactive maps with Leaflet.js (an opensource mapping library)
